We propose an educational, solution-driven website powered by NASA Earth observation datasets to visualize CO₂ emissions, air quality, green space loss, and water stress. The platform will inform residents and policymakers about current conditions and guide practical solutions. Key solutions include expanding green landscapes to absorb CO₂, restore ecosystems, and protect wildlife, as well as addressing the water crisis by treating and reusing sewage water for agriculture and desalinating Gaza’s salty beach water to provide drinking water. Satellite monitoring of water resources and land use will support these efforts. By combining NASA’s data with local solutions, the platform will provide pathways for healthier, sustainable urban growth, helping Gaza rebuild and improving quality of life for its people.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":11,"uuid":"1033","name":"لينه محمد محمود","email":"Linahmohamed2005@gmail.com","phone_number":"01099614643","age":"20","gender":"female","address":"زهراء المعادي","is_new":false,"organization":"October 6 university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30507140103944","created_at":"2025-09-22 18:52:14"},{"id":12,"uuid":"6853","name":"حبيبه عادل محمود","email":"habibaadel508@gmail.com","phone_number":"01067657080","age":"19","gender":"female","address":"٦ اكتوبر الحي الاول","is_new":false,"organization":"October 6 university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30603012707208","created_at":"2025-09-22 18:52:14"},{"id":13,"uuid":"1222","name":"ماريا أكرم فريد","email":"mariaakram102@gmail.com","phone_number":"01208686717","age":"20","gender":"female","address":"امبابه","is_new":false,"organization":"October 6 university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30507242103868","created_at":"2025-09-22 18:52:15"},{"id":14,"uuid":"5864","name":"مصطفي السباعي محمد","email":"Mustafaelsebaee677@gmail.com","phone_number":"01024718420","age":"19","gender":"female","address":"حدايق الاهرام","is_new":false,"organization":"October 6 university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30604011606919","created_at":"2025-09-22 18:52:15"},{"id":15,"uuid":"6218","name":"مصطفي طارق محمود","email":"Mostafat524@gmail.com","phone_number":"01016933711","age":"20","gender":"male","address":"اكتوبر الحي الاول","is_new":false,"organization":"October 6 university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30509052105875","created_at":"2025-09-22 18:52:15"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/4858/inbound9217423653692279478.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/4858/conversions/inbound9217423653692279478-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/4858/conversions/inbound9217423653692279478-preview.jpg,2025-09-22 18:52:14

Sleeping quarters are placed far from noisy or high-activity areas.

Food preparation and storage are separated from waste and hygiene areas to maintain health.

Medical and hygiene facilities are close together but away from rest areas for quiet recovery.

Exercise and recreation spaces are connected to open areas to support both physical and mental health.

This system ensures astronauts have a balanced, functional, and healthy environment that reduces risks of noise, contamination, and overcrowding.

A data pipeline collects, cleans, and aligns the data spatially and temporally (regridding, cloud masking, gap filling). Machine learning and spatio-temporal models are then trained: starting with baselines like XGBoost or Random Forest, and extending to advanced architectures such as ConvLSTM or GCN-LSTM to forecast pollutants , Predictions are served via a cloud API (FastAPI/Docker). The front-end is an interactive mobile app Flutter featuring heatmaps, time-series trends, and uncertainty visualization, along with alerts and actionable recommendations for communities and decision-makers.

Instead of only giving raw data like temperature or wind speed, the app uses NASA Earth observation datasets and translates them into clear categories such as very hot, very cold, very windy, very wet, or very uncomfortable.

Users can simply enter a location and date, and the app provides a personalized forecast. Behind the scenes, WeatherSense combines satellite data with comfort indices like heat index and wind chill to calculate the likelihood of each condition.

This makes weather information easier to understand and directly relevant to outdoor plans, helping users stay safe, avoid disruptions, and enjoy their activities with confidence.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":108,"uuid":"2023","name":"Ibrahim Amr","email":"hema82630@gmail.com","phone_number":"01094573050","age":"20","gender":"male","address":"Al Ghrbia Tanta","is_new":false,"organization":"Tanta University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30505151602451","created_at":"2025-09-25 16:01:58"},{"id":109,"uuid":"6383","name":"Mohamed Atta","email":"mohamedatta8921@gmail.com","phone_number":"01068715157","age":"20","gender":"male","address":"October Giza","is_new":false,"organization":"October 6 University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30508012410652","created_at":"2025-09-25 16:01:58"},{"id":110,"uuid":"5344","name":"Anan Alaa","email":"enganan0262@gmail.com","phone_number":"01014926526","age":"19","gender":"female","address":"Oseem Giza","is_new":false,"organization":"Al Azher university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30511180104487","created_at":"2025-09-25 16:01:58"},{"id":111,"uuid":"2512","name":"Alaa Hesham","email":"alaanaguib96@gmail.com","phone_number":"01000966903","age":"20","gender":"female","address":"6th of October city, Giza","is_new":false,"organization":"Helwan university","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30505141600221","created_at":"2025-09-25 16:01:58"},{"id":112,"uuid":"3995","name":"Aya Ahmed Elsayed","email":"ayaabeed2006@gmail.com","phone_number":"01067409874","age":"19","gender":"female","address":"Cairo-Nasr city","is_new":false,"organization":"Ain Shams University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30603011810285","created_at":"2025-09-25 16:01:58"},{"id":113,"uuid":"5055","name":"Marwa Hemada","email":"marwahemada04@gmail.com","phone_number":"01147561417","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"Cairo, Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Ain Shams University","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30312072400824","created_at":"2025-09-25 16:01:58"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/4981/Gemini_Generated_Image_5c6hrs5c6hrs5c6h_V1.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/4981/conversions/Gemini_Generated_Image_5c6hrs5c6hrs5c6h_V1-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/4981/conversions/Gemini_Generated_Image_5c6hrs5c6hrs5c6h_V1-preview.jpg,2025-09-25 16:01:58

Rather than depending on slow and biased human classification, EXOplorer amalgamates disparate catalogs into a single framework using a stacking ensemble pipeline with LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, with an ROC-AUC score of 96.9. The pipeline predicts the likelihood that a candidate is a true planet and explains the results via SHAP/LIME to build transparency and trust. Provided for scientists and the public, it offers cross-mission exploration coupled with upload-and-classify tools, storytelling, timelines, and the gamification of planet hunting. EXOplorer uses an open-source, community-driven approach to marry scientific integrity with openness, making exoplanet discovery faster, more transparent, and inclusive than ever before.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":143,"uuid":"4066","name":"Abdalla Tamer Mostafa Mahran","email":"abdallatamer1406@gmail.com","phone_number":"01094513905","age":"22","gender":"male","address":"Youssef Abbas St., Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Zewail City of Science and Technology","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30306140106018","created_at":"2025-09-25 20:47:49"},{"id":144,"uuid":"5757","name":"Salma Sherif Hamdy","email":"s-salma.ali@zewailcity.edu.eg","phone_number":"01153634909","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"October Gardens - Zewail City street","is_new":false,"organization":"Zewail City of Science and Technology","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30405172200189","created_at":"2025-09-25 20:47:49"},{"id":145,"uuid":"7915","name":"Doha Hemdan Ismail","email":"s-doha.hassanien@zewailcity.edu.eg","phone_number":"01027030625","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"6th of October - Gamal AbdelNasser Street","is_new":false,"organization":"Zewail City of Science and Technology","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30407012100547","created_at":"2025-09-25 20:47:49"},{"id":146,"uuid":"9204","name":"Farah Mostafa Ahmed","email":"s-farah.ahmed@zewailcity.edu.eg","phone_number":"01027761201","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"El Shaikh Zayed, Giza","is_new":false,"organization":"Zewail City of Science and Technology","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30407102106307","created_at":"2025-09-25 20:47:49"},{"id":147,"uuid":"4866","name":"Nada Mohamed Saad","email":"s-nada.saleh@zewailcity.edu.eg","phone_number":"01008908434","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"Al Fardoos Gardens- Wahat Street","is_new":false,"organization":"Zewail City of Science and Technology","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30405318800582","created_at":"2025-09-25 20:47:49"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5025/Picsart_25-09-25_23-40-26-958.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5025/conversions/Picsart_25-09-25_23-40-26-958-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5025/conversions/Picsart_25-09-25_23-40-26-958-preview.jpg,2025-09-25 20:47:49

Based on Kepler, TESS, and K2 datasets and research papers, we create a unified model that learns diverse planetary signatures across different observation methods. The solution features an interactive web interface where users can submit transit data for instant classification into confirmed exoplanets, candidates, or false positives. This approach enables more accurate and scalable exoplanet discovery than single-mission methods, making advanced astronomical research accessible to both scientists and space enthusiasts. Our hackathon project demonstrates how machine learning can accelerate the search for habitable worlds beyond our solar system.

We clean and align Kepler, K2, and TESS light curves, then let a hybrid model (CNN for shapes, gradient-boosting for context) spot the tiny, honest dips that planets make—and flag the tricks from noise or binaries. But this isn’t a black box: we pair every “candidate” with explanations, saliency highlights, and simple language so humans—astronomers, students, and citizen scientists—can trust and verify. A web app turns results into stories: browse likely worlds, inspect the light, leave notes, and vote on confidence. The loop is human-in-the-middle: AI accelerates, people validate, science advances.

BloomVision doesn’t just show what already happened — it can also predict future blooming. This helps farmers know the best time to harvest, helps doctors warn people about pollen season, and helps scientists track things like invasive plants or climate change effects.

Instead of raw data that’s hard to read, we make it visual, interactive, and useful.

Our idea is to create children’s story that explains space weather in a fun and simple way.
In the story, a solar flare becomes a character travel from sun to earth making Auroras but also causing some problems.
This story will teach children how space weather affects farmers, pilots, astronauts and even people who uses GPS.
Children will learn that the sun is not only a source of light but also a powerful force that can change things on earth.

من هنا جاءت فكرتنا: منصة ذكية متكاملة تجمع بين المراقبة، التعليم، والتوعية.
النظام يتصل مباشرة بأقمار ناسا الصناعية، يحلل التوهجات الشمسية لحظة بلحظة، يصنفها من A إلى X، ويتنبأ بتأثيرها على الأرض مع خرائط ومخططات توضح مناطق الخطر. كما يولّد تقارير وتوصيات عملية للحماية.

وللتعليم، أضفنا لعبة تفاعلية تجعل التعلم مغامرة؛ عند حدوث توهج حقيقي يختار اللاعب استراتيجيات دفاعية لحماية الكهرباء أو الاتصالات أو الأقمار الصناعية، وكل قرار يغيّر حالة الأرض في الوقت الفعلي.

هدفنا تحويل العلم المعقد إلى تجربة ممتعة وواعية، لأن الحماية تبدأ من المعرفة، والوعي هو خط الدفاع الأول.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":251,"uuid":"8236","name":"Esraa Bakry Atia Allah Ali","email":"bakrye088@gmail.com","phone_number":"01024124515","age":"23","gender":"female","address":"M Elamir Itsa fayoum","is_new":false,"organization":"Fayoume University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30208202303425","created_at":"2025-09-26 13:59:00"},{"id":252,"uuid":"5063","name":"اميرة محمد ابراهيم علي","email":"amira.mohamed.nada1234@gmail.com","phone_number":"01203774860","age":"22","gender":"female","address":"مجاورة 18 عمارة 132 العاشر من رمضان - الشلرقية","is_new":false,"organization":"Elshrouk Academy","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"3021212901201","created_at":"2025-09-26 13:59:00"},{"id":253,"uuid":"2950","name":"محمد مختار نور الدين احمد","email":"mmmm.mokhtar191@gmail.com","phone_number":"01142136256","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"4151 زهراء مدينة نصر  -مدنة نصر اول -ا القاهرة","is_new":false,"organization":"Elshrouk Academy","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30402260105472","created_at":"2025-09-26 13:59:00"},{"id":254,"uuid":"1242","name":"محمد محمود محمد كمال عماره","email":"mo7medomara5@gmail.com","phone_number":"01022710642","age":"22","gender":"male","address":"37 ش عبدالله ابو السعود النزهة القاهرة","is_new":false,"organization":"Elshrouk Academy","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30307180101511","created_at":"2025-09-26 13:59:00"},{"id":255,"uuid":"7111","name":"احمد وائل عبدالعظيم مدكور","email":"ahmedwael1234f@gmail.com","phone_number":"01098621455","age":"22","gender":"male","address":"188 زهراء مدينة نصر  -مدنة نصر اول -ا القاهرة","is_new":false,"organization":"Elshrouk Academy","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30311050106675","created_at":"2025-09-26 13:59:00"},{"id":256,"uuid":"8307","name":"زياد اسماعيل محمد فتح الله المحرقاوي","email":"ziadismail949@gmail.com","phone_number":"01153475072","age":"22","gender":"male","address":"908 زهراء مدينة نصر  -مدنة نصر اول -ا القاهرة","is_new":false,"organization":"Elshrouk Academy","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30304020101079","created_at":"2025-09-26 13:59:01"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5161/5960536045974047889.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5161/conversions/5960536045974047889-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5161/conversions/5960536045974047889-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 13:59:00

Using cloud computing and AI, the platform generates short-term forecasts and provides real-time alerts of poor air quality.

The app serves both the public and decision-makers. Vulnerable groups—such as children, the elderly, and residents in industrial zones—receive timely notifications to reduce exposure. Public health officials, school administrators, transportation authorities, and emergency responders access interactive dashboards and visualizations to support rapid, informed decisions about outdoor activities, safety measures, and crisis response.

By combining multi-source data with scalable cloud technology, our solution transforms Earth observation data into actionable insights. The result is a practical tool that empowers communities to anticipate risks, improve health outcomes, and work toward cleaner, safer skies.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":282,"uuid":"2582","name":"Hagar Hisham","email":"hagarbusihisham2022@gmail.com","phone_number":"01554773353","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"Cairo - Haram","is_new":false,"organization":"Fayoum University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"304041502302663","created_at":"2025-09-26 15:05:25"},{"id":283,"uuid":"3642","name":"Salma Yasser","email":"saloomyasser962@gmail.com","phone_number":"01069335349","age":"23","gender":"female","address":"Heliopolis – Nozha Street","is_new":false,"organization":"Fayoum University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30206092300902","created_at":"2025-09-26 15:05:25"},{"id":284,"uuid":"9266","name":"Mahmoud Mohamed","email":"mahmoud.m.g.175@gmail.com","phone_number":"01068534530","age":"22","gender":"male","address":"Giza - Sheikh Zayed","is_new":false,"organization":"Fayoum University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30307158800872","created_at":"2025-09-26 15:05:25"},{"id":285,"uuid":"4671","name":"Eyad Bassem","email":"eyadbassem115@gmail.com","phone_number":"01141584461","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"Beni suef - abdelsalam aref street","is_new":false,"organization":"Fayoum University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30311052201098","created_at":"2025-09-26 15:05:25"},{"id":286,"uuid":"6459","name":"Mohamed Ahmed Galal","email":"mohamed.gallall12@gmail.com","phone_number":"01022546004","age":"22","gender":"male","address":"Beni suef","is_new":false,"organization":"Beni Suef University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30305252201394","created_at":"2025-09-26 15:05:25"},{"id":287,"uuid":"5812","name":"Nada Saleh Saey","email":"nadasaey0@gmail.com","phone_number":"01091284397","age":"25","gender":"female","address":"New Cairo - Roxy","is_new":false,"organization":"Fayoum University","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30009172300245","created_at":"2025-09-26 15:05:25"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5199/WhatsApp-Image-2025-09-26-at-17.47.50_f51ddf36.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5199/conversions/WhatsApp-Image-2025-09-26-at-17.47.50_f51ddf36-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5199/conversions/WhatsApp-Image-2025-09-26-at-17.47.50_f51ddf36-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 15:05:25

The system queries NASA’s historical datasets (POWER, GLDAS, OPeNDAP) to compute probabilities of extreme weather conditions: very hot, very cold, strong winds, heavy rain, and uncomfortable climate.
Outputs are delivered as:
Probabilities in percentage form.
Visuals such as line graphs and heatmaps. 
Downloadable CSV/JSON files with metadata and units.
The chatbot interprets outputs in simple terms and provides context: “70% means 7 out of 10 similar days exceeded 38°C.” It also gives tailored recommendations (e.g., carry water, bring rain protection).

We used trusted NASA data and built a smart model that learns from both past and real-time data to give accurate forecasts. All of this is presented in a simple dashboard with clear charts, and even the background changes depending on the weather—for example, if it’s raining, you’ll see rain on the screen.

Each episode highlights a real event where the Sun’s activity affected Earth: a massive blackout, disrupted flights, satellites thrown off orbit, or the beauty of auroras. Verified cases like the 1989 Hydro-Québec blackout and the 2003 Halloween storms serve as anchors. NASA’s imagery and data provide the science, while human-centered stories bring the emotional side to life.

For the hackathon, we will create a 3–5 minute demo episode in English with captions, showcasing one case in depth, plus outlines for four more episodes.

Users select habitat type (lunar module, Mars transit, inflatable module), define crew size and mission duration, then drag and drop interior components. The system applies NASA standards in real time, providing feedback on space allocation, crew comfort, and operational safety.

Key implementation steps include:
1.	Building drag-and-drop functionality for layout creation.
2.	Integrating a rules engine for constraint checking.
3.	Developing instant visualization in 2D/3D.
4.	Allowing scenario comparison (different layouts, crew numbers, durations).
5.	Optionally, enabling social sharing of designs

This solution directly addresses the challenge by combining scientific credibility with usability, making space habitat design engaging, educational, and efficient.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":401,"uuid":"7769","name":"Mohsen Muhammed Elsayed Hamed","email":"mohsen.mo.elsayed@gmail.com","phone_number":"01273560057","age":"22","gender":"male","address":"Hehia - Sharqia","is_new":false,"organization":"Zagazig university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30301151307218","created_at":"2025-09-26 17:33:27"},{"id":402,"uuid":"7759","name":"Ziad Safwat Mohammed Ibrahim","email":"ziadsafwataraby@gmail.com","phone_number":"01124816059","age":"24","gender":"male","address":"Beni-suef / ihnasyia elmadinah","is_new":false,"organization":"University of Beni-suef","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30107192200737","created_at":"2025-09-26 17:33:27"},{"id":403,"uuid":"3893","name":"Mostafa Ahmed Mostafa Mohamed","email":"mostafaahmed5332442@gmail.com","phone_number":"01003801340","age":"22","gender":"male","address":"10th of Rammadan / Elsharqia","is_new":false,"organization":"Zagazig university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30309270106191","created_at":"2025-09-26 17:33:27"},{"id":404,"uuid":"6514","name":"Mohamed Mohsen Borham","email":"mohamedborham207@gmail.com","phone_number":"01016261928","age":"19","gender":"male","address":"Mansoura - Dakahlia","is_new":false,"organization":"Mansoura University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30511211200757","created_at":"2025-09-26 17:33:27"},{"id":405,"uuid":"3916","name":"Salma Khaled Soliman Mohammed","email":"salmakhaled.soliman5@gmail.com","phone_number":"01064035378","age":"19","gender":"female","address":"Red Sea-Hurghada- El Hegaz Street","is_new":false,"organization":"MUST","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30605083100102","created_at":"2025-09-26 17:33:27"},{"id":406,"uuid":"9990","name":"Mai Mohammed abd Elmongy Zaid","email":"mmy626519@gmail.com","phone_number":"01091374285","age":"22","gender":"female","address":"Elmonofia","is_new":false,"organization":"university of banha","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"3030401174224","created_at":"2025-09-26 17:33:27"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5346/Group-Photo-ECHOX.png,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5346/conversions/Group-Photo-ECHOX-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5346/conversions/Group-Photo-ECHOX-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 17:33:27

TESS provides one of the most recent and comprehensive datasets, covering almost the entire sky. However, it is also highly noisy and contains many false positives, which makes it both challenging and valuable for training intelligent models.

We aim to develop two complementary approaches:
1. Machine Learning (XGBoost) applied on tabular features such as orbital period, transit depth, stellar radius, and temperature.
2. Deep Learning (CNNs) applied directly on raw light curves to automatically learn transit patterns.
Our workflow will include data preprocessing and balancing, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using metrics such as ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, accuracy, precision, and recall.

Satellites and orbital platforms generate large amounts of heat, usually expelled into space with radiators. Our compact device, about the size of a pizza box, uses thermoelectric generators (TEGs) to convert this unused heat directly into electricity. The system can be installed on satellites, stations, or tourism platforms to provide three key benefits: free power for CubeSats and onboard systems, efficient heating for modules without added energy costs, and a new revenue stream for operators by monetizing what was once discarded. Delivered through a “Power-as-a-Service” model, we supply energy at no upfront cost in exchange for a share of the savings. This approach reduces waste, cuts operational expenses, and promotes a circular economy in orbit.

A medium-paced, easily read and fun story about the journey of a solar flare approaching earth.
1- The story starts with a farmer going back to work on an old road away from all the light pollution of the big cities.
2- As the farmer drives in the silent dark road, he spots a faint light in the sky. He is captured by the beauty of the color, and this is where the transition happens
4- The ambience of the story slowly fades away from the farmer and then to the solar flare, thousands of kilometers away.
5- We describe the solar flare, his name, age and why he's here all in a narrator style.
6- The story continues and explains the causes and importance of the solar flares
7- In the end the flare reaches its destination and becomes one with our planet welcome by all his friends.,null,2,virtual,null,[{"id":482,"uuid":"6191","name":"Samy Mohamed Swelim","email":"samymohamedgo16@gmail.com","phone_number":"01212107290","age":"15","gender":"male","address":"1, Al Badr, Helwan, Cairo","is_new":false,"organization":"STEM High School for boys - 6th of October","participation_type":2,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30909280501096","created_at":"2025-09-26 18:39:23"},{"id":483,"uuid":"5715","name":"Islam Essam Ahmed","email":"eslamessam346@gmail.com","phone_number":"01068240128","age":"16","gender":"male","address":"37b, Mohamed Refaat Street, el motamayez district, 6th of October, Giza","is_new":false,"organization":"STEM High School for boys - 6th of October","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30902192100419","created_at":"2025-09-26 18:39:23"},{"id":484,"uuid":"1857","name":"Adham Mohamed Sayed","email":"adhammohamed17709@gmail.com","phone_number":"01111311938","age":"16","gender":"male","address":"4, Mohamed Abdullah st, Mazraet Al-Baet, Maadi, Cairo","is_new":false,"organization":"STEM High School for boys - 6th of October","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30907170100751","created_at":"2025-09-26 18:39:23"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5446/IMG_20250926_204520.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5446/conversions/IMG_20250926_204520-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5446/conversions/IMG_20250926_204520-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 18:39:23

The platform features a world map where users can select a region and either enter asteroid details such as size and speed, or choose one from NASA’s NEO API. Depending on the chosen area, the tool will use combined datasets to show possible outcomes.

To make it more engaging, we will add a deflection mode where users can attempt to alter the asteroid’s path and see whether Earth is hit or saved. This makes the science easier to understand while remaining realistic.

The app allows users to either manually select features they want or let an ML model predict relevant ones based on their tasks. It integrates location, date, and time (day, month, year, hour) to provide context-aware suggestions. Users can enter or select an activity, and the system evaluates whether it is suitable given the current or predicted conditions (e.g., too hot, rainy, etc.). The output is not only visual but also enhanced with sound effects (like rain sounds if it’s rainy), making the experience engaging. If the chosen activity is unsuitable, the app can recommend alternative activities that better fit the weather and timing.

What makes it different from a normal weather app is that it doesn’t just give raw numbers or percentages, it actually gives you clear recommendations. For example, if you want to plan a picnic, the app won’t just tell you there’s a 40% chance of rain; it will suggest better days where the conditions are perfect.

The story follow four young students who win a competition and embark on a space mission to learn about solar phenomena like solar flares, CMEs, and solar winds. Along the way, they face fictionalized enemies inspired by real space weather effects, such as GPS disruption, power outages, and environmental hazards.

The project combines engaging storytelling, manga art, and educational science content, making learning fun and relatable. By using characters with no superpowers—just skills and teamwork—we show young audiences that anyone can be a hero in protecting our planet.

Our approach bridges the gap between entertainment and education, helping youth understand complex scientific concepts while enjoying content that reflects their interests, like anime and comics.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":545,"uuid":"1454","name":"Mohamed Tamer Mohamed Ibrahim","email":"mohammed.tamer06@gmail.com","phone_number":"01010692070","age":"19","gender":"male","address":"Abuzaabal,Qalyubia","is_new":false,"organization":"Zewail City for science and technology","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30611068800815","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:15:20"},{"id":546,"uuid":"4233","name":"Marwan Ali Hussien","email":"Maro01122134381@gmail.com","phone_number":"01014425388","age":"19","gender":"male","address":"Boulaq Al Dakrour, Giza","is_new":false,"organization":"Ain shams university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30608202503538","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:15:20"},{"id":547,"uuid":"7576","name":"Essam Mohamed Elkholy","email":"essam2007moh@gmail.com","phone_number":"01097269232","age":"18","gender":"male","address":"Ain shams- Cairo","is_new":false,"organization":"egypt japan university of science and technology","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30701251702732","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:15:20"},{"id":548,"uuid":"1026","name":"Mohamed Awad Nabieh","email":"mwd4814@gmail.com","phone_number":"01094212235","age":"20","gender":"male","address":"Cairo, Maadi, Kozzika","is_new":false,"organization":"egypt japan university of science and technology","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30502090101897","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:15:20"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5524/eb629338-a80f-49c5-a5fd-bc27662aeca2.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5524/conversions/eb629338-a80f-49c5-a5fd-bc27662aeca2-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5524/conversions/eb629338-a80f-49c5-a5fd-bc27662aeca2-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 19:15:20

Instead of treating trash as useless, the pod sorts, processes, and repurposes materials such as plastics, textiles, and metals into valuable resources for the crew. The system consists of three core stages: automated sorting (using simple detection methods or AI vision to separate waste types), material-specific processing (plastics converted into 3D-printing filament, metals marked for recovery, textiles repurposed as insulation), and output storage for reuse.

The concept will be presented as a digital model with flow diagrams, CAD mockups, and infographics to show how waste flows through the system and what useful products can be generated. By reducing storage needs, resupply dependency, and mission costs, Trash-to-Tools ensures that nothing on Mars goes to waste — trash becomes tools for survival.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":549,"uuid":"8339","name":"Malak Ahmed","email":"malakhabak56@gmail.com","phone_number":"01224543273","age":"19","gender":"female","address":"4 الفريق محمد إبراهيم متفرع من حسنين هيكل مديمة نصر","is_new":false,"organization":"Zewail City of Science and technology","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30602042800346","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:15:24"},{"id":550,"uuid":"6530","name":"Manar Ahmed","email":"s-manar.awad@zewailcity.edu.eg","phone_number":"01061947189","age":"19","gender":"female","address":"Obour city ninth district mohammed abd elwahab street","is_new":false,"organization":"Zewail City of Science and Technology","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30603231202944","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:15:24"},{"id":551,"uuid":"7534","name":"Kevin Wessam","email":"kevinwessam3@gmail.com","phone_number":"01229349774","age":"20","gender":"male","address":"17 policemen city, hadayek helwan, cairo","is_new":false,"organization":"Zewail City Of Science and Technology","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30507050106154","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:15:24"},{"id":552,"uuid":"3725","name":"Abdallah Ahmed","email":"s-abdallah.elshershaby@zewailcity.edu.eg","phone_number":"01201543003","age":"19","gender":"male","address":"17 Ismail Morshed St, Nasr City, Cairo","is_new":false,"organization":"Zewail City Of Science and Technology","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30605080101353","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:15:24"},{"id":553,"uuid":"7491","name":"Abanoub Emad Said Kamel","email":"abanoubemad@aucegypt.edu","phone_number":"01285566153","age":"23","gender":"male","address":"23 Gamal Abd Al Naser St, Cairo, Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"The American University in Cairo","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30205210100496","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:15:24"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5529/Screenshot-2025-09-26-213533.png,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5529/conversions/Screenshot-2025-09-26-213533-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5529/conversions/Screenshot-2025-09-26-213533-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 19:15:24

Unlike traditional weather apps that only forecast a few days ahead, CTRL + Sky provides long-range weather probabilities weeks or even months in advance.

Users can drop a pin on the map, select a date, and choose the weather conditions they want to avoid — such as heavy rain, extreme heat, or strong winds. Our system processes historical climate datasets like MERRA-2 and POWER, calculates how often those conditions occurred in the past, and presents the probability through an intuitive dashboard with maps, charts, and downloadable reports.

This empowers event organizers, travelers, and outdoor workers to make smarter decisions — from picking the safest dates for festivals and weddings to preparing for climate risks.

We aim to create a time-lapse animation that highlights how pollution levels have changed over time, and how these changes affect both the environment and people’s daily lives. To achieve this, we will combine data from three of Terra’s instruments: MOPITT (to measure carbon monoxide and trace gases), MODIS (to monitor aerosols and overall air quality patterns), and ASTER (to provide detailed, high-resolution imagery of Cairo’s urban landscape). By aligning these datasets, we can tell a layered story that shows both the scale and the local impact of pollution.

Users drop a pin, draw a polygon, or upload a GPX/GeoJSON route; the Spring Boot backend queries NASA Earthdata services (e.g., GES DISC OPeNDAP, Giovanni) to assemble multi‑decadal, location‑specific distributions for temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity, and derived heat index. A lightweight ML layer converts user‑set thresholds into exceedance probabilities and trend signals, presenting bell curves, calendar heatmaps, and plain‑language summaries in a React UI. H2 stores queries, presets, and cached statistics for rapid iteration during the hackathon, with CSV/JSON export including units and source references.

Using before-and-after SAR imagery from NASA Earthdata and Copernicus, we examined changes in radar backscatter and polarization to identify flooded areas, collapsed structures, and altered landscapes. This allowed us to build an evidence-based picture of how the flood reshaped the city.

But we didn’t want this to remain only technical. To make the findings meaningful, we translated the data into a story that highlights both the science and the human impact. Through visuals, ArcGIS StoryMaps, and a short video, we bring the radar imagery to life in a way that can be understood by anyone—not just specialists. In doing so, our solution turns complex data into an accessible narrative, ensuring Derna’s story is remembered and its lessons shared.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":582,"uuid":"9254","name":"Ahmed Mohamed Elshahat Mostafa Gharabawy","email":"ahmedelghrabawy28@gmail.com","phone_number":"01224309198","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"Sharqia-Zagazig","is_new":false,"organization":"Zagazig University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30407011308918","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:24:29"},{"id":583,"uuid":"1428","name":"Ahmed Mohamed Elsayed Ahmed Azab","email":"ahmed.aazab.dev@gmail.com","phone_number":"01025584346","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"Sharqia-Abukbeer","is_new":false,"organization":"Zagazig University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30311011316379","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:24:29"},{"id":584,"uuid":"2703","name":"Mahmoud Wadea Attia","email":"mahmoudwadea54@gmail.com","phone_number":"01061719040","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"Sharqia-Aasher","is_new":false,"organization":"Zagazig University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30404071302413","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:24:29"},{"id":585,"uuid":"8483","name":"Asmaa Mohamed Saleh Mohamed","email":"asmaasaleh185@gmail.com","phone_number":"01064820135","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"Sharqia-Ibrahmia","is_new":false,"organization":"Zagazig University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30404231301508","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:24:29"},{"id":586,"uuid":"3415","name":"Hussein Raed Ibrahim Mohamed","email":"kacc2431@gmail.com","phone_number":"01205251472","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"Sharqia-Hehia","is_new":false,"organization":"Zagazig University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30409071301052","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:24:29"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5570/Nasa-Champions-(1).png,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5570/conversions/Nasa-Champions-(1)-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5570/conversions/Nasa-Champions-(1)-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 19:24:29

However, a simple way of learning the information is not the best option for Gen Z teenagers.

 Thus, we have decided to give them one, one in which you do not even realize that you are learning. We created an “Interactive Mapping GHG emissions Tool” from real world data of factories and a prototype game on Egypt that they would find fun and teach them in the process. Our game is a board-type game with cards. On the other hand, we also developed a website that contains a map that showcases various factories across Egypt, represented by circular markers. That website serves as an interactive mapping tool that is scientific and a database for those who want to solely learn or those who desire to learn more.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":603,"uuid":"6920","name":"Ahmed Gamal","email":"ahmedgimy907@gmail.com","phone_number":"01012042378","age":"19","gender":"male","address":"Faiyum","is_new":false,"organization":"Faiyum University - Faculty of Computers","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30608082303351","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:30:17"},{"id":604,"uuid":"2206","name":"Yamen Samer Radwan","email":"yamen.s978@gmail.com","phone_number":"01016017432","age":"18","gender":"male","address":"El-Nasr road, Nasr City, Cairo","is_new":false,"organization":"Helwan University - Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30705050101558","created_at":"2025-09-26 19:30:17"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5595/Yamen-and-Ahmed-Gamal-Photo.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5595/conversions/Yamen-and-Ahmed-Gamal-Photo-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5595/conversions/Yamen-and-Ahmed-Gamal-Photo-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 19:30:17

Our project began with one question: how can NASA’s vast, complex Earth data be transformed into something anyone—even children—can understand and enjoy?

Our answer is Aqua’s Journey, the story of a curious water droplet who guides children through the water cycle. In just three minutes, Aqua dives into the ocean, rises into clouds, swirls through storms, soars into orbit, and returns to Earth as rain. At every stage, real NASA datasets—ocean temperatures, cloud maps, storm trackers, satellite views—are woven into colorful, playful animations that make science feel alive.

Behind Aqua is our team, combining data exploration, design, animation, and narration to turn raw information into discovery.

In humid cities, high atmospheric moisture weakens buildings and harms indoor health. Humidity-sensitive facades using NASA humidity data (AIRS, MODIS) and smart materials can regulate airflow and moisture, reducing mold and structural damage. Cities also consume huge energy for cooling and lighting due to solar radiation. Solar-adaptive architecture applies NASA solar and thermal data (CERES, MODIS) to design facades with reflective coatings and dynamic shading that respond to sunlight, cutting energy use and improving comfort. Urban zones are also key CO₂ sources. Carbon-absorbing facades integrate bio-based or chemical materials that capture carbon, guided by NASA OCO-2 data.

It integrates NASA POWER datasets (rainfall, temperature, solar radiation) and MODIS satellite imagery to create daily farming scenarios based on real climate conditions. Step 1: NASA climate and Earth observation data are collected through open APIs. Step 2: The system processes this data to simulate soil moisture, crop growth, and water needs. Step 3: Players choose actions—irrigate, fertilize, or wait—based on these conditions. Step 4: An algorithm evaluates decisions against real crop models, showing outcomes such as yield, water saved, or crop loss. Step 5: A dashboard summarizes farm sustainability and resource efficiency. By transforming complex data into a simple, engaging simulation, SmartFarm Navigator demonstrates how satellite data can guide smarter farming, improve climate resilience, and promote sustainable agriculture while educating communities through play.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":727,"uuid":"9194","name":"Mohaned Mohammed","email":"mohandmohamed104@gmail.com","phone_number":"01129955082","age":"22","gender":"male","address":"Cairo, Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Cairo university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30302190106153","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:11:59"},{"id":728,"uuid":"5303","name":"Abdelrahman Emad","email":"abdelrahman.emad46.learn@gmail.com","phone_number":"01000220869","age":"20","gender":"male","address":"Cairo, Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Cairo University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30306290105338","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:12:00"},{"id":729,"uuid":"1652","name":"Hagar Saleh","email":"mohammedhagar354@gmail.com","phone_number":"01102815356","age":"22","gender":"female","address":"Giza, Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Mansoura University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30304302300384","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:12:00"},{"id":730,"uuid":"1843","name":"Mohamed Amr Ibrahim Elmasry","email":"mohelmasry113@gmail.com","phone_number":"01016161512","age":"22","gender":"male","address":"Cairo, Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Cairo university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30302260102959","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:12:00"},{"id":731,"uuid":"5491","name":"Kenzy Ragab Sobhy Mohamed","email":"kenzysobhy2003@gmail.com","phone_number":"01226963933","age":"22","gender":"female","address":"Giza,Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Cairo university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30304220102002","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:12:00"},{"id":732,"uuid":"4562","name":"Ahmed Yehya Nafea","email":"Ahmedyehya180@gmail.com","phone_number":"01207871173","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"Tanta, Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Cairo university","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30404181602536","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:12:00"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5746/28718656-c731-4066-af27-9d1a42f5aaf9.jpeg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5746/conversions/28718656-c731-4066-af27-9d1a42f5aaf9-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5746/conversions/28718656-c731-4066-af27-9d1a42f5aaf9-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 20:11:59

The goal is to distinguish between confirmed planets, candidates, and false positives. A key challenge is dataset imbalance, where false positives outnumber confirmed planets. To address this, we will apply feature selection to prevent data leakage and use resampling strategies such as SMOTE, undersampling, and class weighting to balance the data during training. This ensures the model generalizes better and avoids bias toward the majority class.

The model’s output will be integrated into a user-friendly web interface, allowing users to upload files or manually input parameters (e.g., orbital period, transit duration, planetary radius). The system will return predictions, light curves, and accuracy statistics.

The game has three levels, one for primary school, one for middle school, and one for high school so each age group gets a story that matches what they can understand. In every level, players meet characters like farmers, pilots, astronauts, and power-grid workers and see how things like solar flares and big bursts from the Sun can affect their lives.

Instead of just reading, players take part in short challenges, click on animations, and answer quick questions to move forward. Younger players get simple words and bright pictures; older players get deeper facts and harder questions. All of the information and pictures come from NASA, so it’s real science but told in a way that feels like a game.

Air pollution, particularly particulate matter, poses serious risks to human health, climate, and ecosystems, making effective filtration urgently needed. The system works by passing polluted air between two metal plates connected to a mosquito zapper that provides high voltage (5000 volts). As the air flows through, particles like dust, smoke and other pollutants become electrically charged and are attracted to the plates, leaving cleaner air to exit the device. This method is energy efficient and cost effective since it relies on simple materials and requires minimal maintenance. The design can be scaled to serve small indoor spaces like classrooms and homes, as well as larger urban environments.

Exoplanets are extremely difficult to find because they are small, faint, and hidden by their stars’ bright light. Traditional methods require a lot of time and expertise, but AI can make this process faster and more accurate.

The system works in two main steps. First, it applies computer vision to telescope images, using deep learning to identify tiny patterns that might indicate a planet. Second, it analyzes light curves, which show how a star’s brightness changes over time. If a planet passes in front of a star, the brightness dips slightly, and AI can detect this signal with high precision.

By looking closely at these small changes in brightness, it becomes possible to spot hidden worlds far beyond our own solar system.

In our tool, a user will be able to type in or select a star, and the system will automatically collect its brightness data from NASA’s public archives. The tool will then analyze this information and show clear, easy-to-read graphs along with a simple score that suggests whether a planet might be there.

It starts with a preprocessing pipeline that prepares NASA’s Kepler, K2, and TESS datasets for analysis, ensuring cross-mission compatibility. Using ensemble methods such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and hierarchical classification for complex multi-class cases like TESS, the system reduces false positives and increases recall for more accurate results.

What makes our approach unique is the deployment of these models through a user-friendly web interface. Researchers can upload or input data, run classifications in real time, and view interactive visualizations of outcomes.

They give water, food, and balance to the world around them. But many rivers today are struggling—pollution, climate change, and human pressure are taking a heavy toll.
Our goal is to build a platform that connects science with people’s everyday stories. It shows satellite images, water quality data, and time-lapse views of how rivers change. With the help of AI, it can warn about possible pollution waves and give clear advice—sometimes as small as avoiding certain activities, other times by joining community clean-up events.
To keep people engaged, the platform also adds a playful side. Schools, farmers, and families can take part in challenges to protect the rivers.
In the end, Breathing Rivers is about more than awareness. It’s about showing that small steps matter, and that protecting rivers is something we can only achieve together.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":913,"uuid":"8101","name":"Aya Emad Abdullatif","email":"ayaaemad2005@gmail.com","phone_number":"01119585099","age":"20","gender":"female","address":"shoubra ,cairo","is_new":false,"organization":"Cairo University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30504231400969","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:50:10"},{"id":914,"uuid":"8582","name":"Abdelrahman Emad Ali","email":"abdelrahman.abdelmeged05@eng-st.cu.edu.eg","phone_number":"01032723117","age":"20","gender":"male","address":"giza- Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Cairo University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30506092103639","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:50:10"},{"id":915,"uuid":"3282","name":"Ahmed Maged Mohammed","email":"ahmed.khattaby05@eng-st.cu.edu.eg","phone_number":"01060567724","age":"20","gender":"male","address":"كورنيش النيل-عماير الجيش","is_new":false,"organization":"Cairo University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30509231601176","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:50:10"},{"id":916,"uuid":"3693","name":"Ziad Osama Esmail","email":"ziad.ebrahim04@eng-st.cu.edu.eg","phone_number":"01006699668","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"15 of may city","is_new":false,"organization":"Cairo University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30404200103678","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:50:10"},{"id":917,"uuid":"5083","name":"Youssef Mohamed Megahed","email":"yosefmohamed532006@gmail.com","phone_number":"01155626187","age":"19","gender":"male","address":"Hatem roshdy, beni suef , beni suef governorate , Egypt, 62511","is_new":false,"organization":"Cairo University","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30603052301697","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:50:10"},{"id":918,"uuid":"9206","name":"Mai Ahmed Mostafa","email":"Mai.halim05@eng-st.cu.edu.eg","phone_number":"01101792747","age":"20","gender":"female","address":"Manshat El Qunater-giza","is_new":false,"organization":"Cairo University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30510152100585","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:50:10"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5976/Untitled-design.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5976/conversions/Untitled-design-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5976/conversions/Untitled-design-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 20:50:10

It bridges astronomy education with the excitement of discovery, offering more immersion than books or documentaries.

The problem is that current tools lack engaging, interactive ways to feel the scale of space. Our solution uses NASA’s high resolution images-often over 1GB-divided into tiles, like Google Maps. With Smart Tile Swapping, devices load only what’s needed: lightweight previews when zoomed out, and full-resolution data when zoomed in.

This ensures smooth access on VR headsets for full immersion, and also on phones and computers for users without VR hardware. By combining VR, scientific accuracy, and smart data handling, the project delivers both education and adventure.

The system doesn’t just show temperature or rainfall — it evaluates how safe or risky conditions are for specific activities and even considers age groups like children and seniors.

Users can quickly know if their planned trip is ✔ suitable or ❌ not recommended, with a clear explanation of why (e.g., extreme heat, heavy rain, or unsafe humidity levels). The interactive dashboard includes modern visuals, maps with local cultural icons (like pyramids in Egypt or the Kaaba in Saudi Arabia), and simple charts that explain probabilities.

The challenge is the vast size and complexity of JWST, MRO, and LRO gigapixel and terapixel mission imagery, which is hard to access for students, teachers, and the general public. Our site solves this by displaying enormous images in multi-resolution that pan and zoom frictionlessly without needing to download massive files. Users can query datasets by keyword, coordinates, or feature names, and explore interactive labels that explain image features in plain language. An AI chatbot helps to answer users' questions, break down the science jargon, and link to NASA's official resources. The website also permits the addition of subtle 2D/3D effects and background sound, if needed, to enhance the experience for users.

BioSpace-KG solves this by transforming 602 curated space biology papers into an intelligent, conversational knowledge platform. Using LLMGraphTransformer, we extract entities and relationships to build a Neo4j-powered knowledge graph, then integrate GraphRAG for natural language querying. This lets researchers, mission planners, and medical teams interact with the literature directly—asking complex questions and receiving evidence-backed answers with citations. The platform adds AI-powered research assistance (paper-level chat, TL;DRs, and data visualizations) plus community detection to cluster themes, reveal hidden links, and expose gaps.

The goal is to overcome the barrier of data complexity by providing a user-centered interface.

Users follow a smallholder farmer facing crises like drought or heat waves. At decision points, a simple dashboard displays two key KPIs: Soil Moisture and Heat Index, derived from NASA products (like SMAP/Crop-CASMA). Players choose actionable strategies, such as adjusting irrigation or switching crops.

The platform provides immediate feedback, updating a Sustainability Score and Resource Balance. This core mechanism effectively converts complex EO products into intuitive game mechanics, simulating actions under real-world constraints.

Our project is Celebration of Terra Data.

The idea comes from a real problem in Egypt: thousands of tons of vegetables and fruits are wasted every day, while industrial waste accumulates and harms the environment. Over time, this waste has become normalized in society.

We asked: how can we make people truly feel this data?
Our solution is to transform Earth data into simple awareness animations. These visuals show the scale of waste, its effects on soil, water, and air, and how small changes in behavior can shape a better environmental future.

Our goal is to turn cold numbers into vivid, relatable stories that reach everyone—from children to adults—making data engaging and impactful.

Red Planet Recycler, is a complete system to handle waste on Mars. 

How it works: An auto robot, called "Collect Trash," uses its AI camera to find trash(waste ) around Jezero Crater. His arm picks up the trash and carries it to the "RecycleHub." At the hub, the trash is sorted. Plastics are shredded into small pieces that can be fed into a 3D printer, while metals are compacted and saved for other uses.

Instead of reading boring facts, you’re in the story and you see how space weather messes with real people. Like a farmer whose GPS tractor breaks, or a pilot dealing with flight problems. You help them out through mini games, and while you’re playing you actually learn the science. It’s web-based too, so you can just open it and play without downloading anything.
This way, space weather feels less like some random science topic and more like an adventure you’re part of. It makes the hard stuff easier to get, and honestly way more fun. Plus, it could get kids actually curious about space and science instead of zoning out. That’s the whole point, making it something people remember instead of something they skip over.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1028,"uuid":"8029","name":"Obay Rashad","email":"obay.developer@gmail.com","phone_number":"01034937227","age":"16","gender":"male","address":"25 Abd Al Khaleq Mashaal Street, Mit Hebesh Al Baharia, Tanta, 31752","is_new":false,"organization":"el Gala high school for boys","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30811171603156","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:57:52"},{"id":1029,"uuid":"9385","name":"Youssef Ayman","email":"yous102008@gmail.com","phone_number":"01286592230","age":"16","gender":"male","address":"Tailba fom Faisel st,Giza","is_new":false,"organization":"STEM 6th oct","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30811011309871","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:57:52"},{"id":1030,"uuid":"6881","name":"Nader sayed ahmed sayed","email":"nadersayed742@gmail.com","phone_number":"01022137648","age":"16","gender":"male","address":"6th of October, 800 fadan sector gem","is_new":false,"organization":"STEM 6th oct","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30901030601736","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:57:52"},{"id":1031,"uuid":"9490","name":"Kareem Ahmed","email":"koreemahmadabdelkareem@gmail.com","phone_number":"01020846285","age":"17","gender":"male","address":"Monofeya shebin elkom mit khakan","is_new":false,"organization":"STEM 6th oct","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30805101700111","created_at":"2025-09-26 20:57:52"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6114/f460ace9-37ca-4d6e-9c7f-a5fb7d375706.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6114/conversions/f460ace9-37ca-4d6e-9c7f-a5fb7d375706-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6114/conversions/f460ace9-37ca-4d6e-9c7f-a5fb7d375706-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 20:57:52

The web application serves as the deployment layer, allowing non-specialists to interact with the model. Users can input object features (orbital radius, transit depth, etc.), and the system provides predictions with an explanation of the confidence score.

Implementation steps include:

Finalizing data preprocessing and model training.

Selecting the best-performing algorithm based on evaluation metrics.

Building the web app and integrating APIs for real-time inference.

Testing with unseen data to ensure generalization.

Instead of hunting through PDFs about bone loss and plant growth in microgravity, researchers just ask questions in plain English: "What happens to astronaut bone density on long missions?"

Our system pulls relevant findings from multiple studies, synthesizes conflicting results, and shows you exactly which papers support each claim. You can keep digging deeper - "How does that compare to mouse studies?" "What countermeasures work best?" - and get answers backed by real citations.

Think NotebookLM but specifically trained on space biology terminology. Upload papers, chat with decades of NASA research, get the insights you actually need.

AquaSight is an AI-powered system shifting shark conservation from reactive to proactive. It achieves over 90% accuracy in habitat prediction across 90% of global oceans by integrating cutting-edge NASA satellite data (PACE, SWOT, MODIS).

The core innovation relies on a mathematical framework that links satellite-observed phytoplankton to shark prey using a trophic cascade model, and identifies optimal thermal conditions (like "thermal elevators").

We introduce revolutionary Smart Tags (conceptual multi-sensor devices) that provide 95% accurate, real-time feeding analysis—unprecedented behavioral data.

A global accessibility platform (web dashboard and mobile app) ensures researchers, educators, and the public can use the predictive maps and data.

Using NASA datasets such as MODIS, LANDSAT, MOPITT, AIRS, and POWER, the system provides a decade of historical data and AI projections for the upcoming decade.

Planners can select a location on an interactive map, examine past temperature and pollution trends, and view worst case future projections if no action is taken. They can then propose interventions such as planting trees, reflective surfaces, or improved traffic flow and the AI evaluates each plan. The system calculates the impact of these actions , showing how much they reduce temperature and pollution levels.

NaVerse.ai delivers actionable insights, bridging the gap between raw data and decision making. The process simplifies datasets, ensures evidence based planning, and promotes healthier, sustainable cities.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1209,"uuid":"7229","name":"Mohammed Mohammed Yousuf Abdelrazek Ahmed","email":"mohammed.ahmed.stem@gmail.com","phone_number":"01110008687","age":"13","gender":"male","address":"Al-Mohandiseen, Giza","is_new":false,"organization":"Al-Orman Secondary School for Boys","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30905140601214","created_at":"2025-09-26 21:30:33"},{"id":1210,"uuid":"1335","name":"Mariam Mohamed Fathy Mohamed","email":"mariam311mohamed@gmail.com","phone_number":"01020828516","age":"16","gender":"female","address":"El Haram, Giza","is_new":false,"organization":"Pyramids National & international schools","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30811032105222","created_at":"2025-09-26 21:30:33"},{"id":1211,"uuid":"4953","name":"Omar Tamer Elazab Melegy Dyab","email":"alkon.ge1@gmail.com","phone_number":"01064993753","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"Tanta Elgharbia","is_new":false,"organization":"Tanta university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30403071602151","created_at":"2025-09-26 21:30:33"},{"id":1212,"uuid":"4444","name":"Mariam Tabina Ahmed","email":"mariamtabina7@gmail.com","phone_number":"01067379120","age":"17","gender":"female","address":"Faisal, Giza","is_new":false,"organization":"STEM Oct 11th District","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30804101703726","created_at":"2025-09-26 21:30:33"},{"id":1213,"uuid":"8533","name":"Mohamed Mostafa Alsayed Alawakey","email":"mohamedelawakey@gmail.com","phone_number":"01127247680","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"ElMahala , Elgharbia","is_new":false,"organization":"Tanta university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30406241600492","created_at":"2025-09-26 21:30:33"},{"id":1214,"uuid":"6386","name":"Esraa Hussien Mohamed","email":"ehussien143@gmail.com","phone_number":"01101081466","age":"20","gender":"female","address":"Elmaasara , Helwan , Cairo","is_new":false,"organization":"Cairo University","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30412090103025","created_at":"2025-09-26 21:30:33"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6344/5dfab493-1915-4cd1-9081-844afbabd0c2.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6344/conversions/5dfab493-1915-4cd1-9081-844afbabd0c2-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6344/conversions/5dfab493-1915-4cd1-9081-844afbabd0c2-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 21:30:33

These star signals often show changes that might suggest the presence of a planet, yet such variations can also come from other causes like asteroids, nearby stars, or random electromagnetic disturbances. The idea is to carefully compare these patterns and highlight the differences that truly point to a planet. In addition, users can upload their own observations in the form of images or datasets. These will be matched against NASA’s records to check for similarities and differences. At the end, the system provides a probability score showing whether the detected variation is more likely connected to an exoplanet or something else.

Waste from fabrics, packaging, and structural composites consumes valuable storage and demands costly resupply. To address this, we propose the Jezero Resource Reclamation Hub (J-RRH)—a fully automated recycling system enabling high vehicle-crew autonomy (G5/G6). J-RRH converts waste into usable resources through: (1) mechanical shredding and separation of plastics and metals, (2) thermal pyrolysis of composites at 550 °C in inert conditions to recover reinforcement fibers, and (3) hydrogen generation from plastic-derived syngas, purified with PdAg membranes for fuel and synthesis. These outputs—AM filament, recovered fibers, and hydrogen—support in-situ manufacturing and energy needs. This solution aligns with NASA’s goal of minimizing launch mass, maximizing crew productivity, and sustaining operations at Jezero Crater.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1239,"uuid":"4969","name":"Abd ELRahman Seddik","email":"abdo.seddik20190101@gmail.com","phone_number":"01226722225","age":"22","gender":"male","address":"Sharqia, Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Zagazig University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30309261302735","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:12:41"},{"id":1240,"uuid":"2630","name":"Mariam Elemam","email":"mariamelemam82@gmail.com","phone_number":"01020073599","age":"22","gender":"female","address":"Damietta,Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"University of Science, Technology and innovation at Zewailcity","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30207041100727","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:12:41"},{"id":1241,"uuid":"3532","name":"Asmaa Hossam","email":"asmaahossam289@gmail.com","phone_number":"01014717368","age":"20","gender":"female","address":"Sharqia, Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Beni Swif University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30509281303141","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:12:41"},{"id":1242,"uuid":"2438","name":"Mohamed Atef Saad","email":"medo202301@gmail.com","phone_number":"01099991838","age":"20","gender":"male","address":"kafr el sheikh, Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Uni (dental student)","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30511011507858","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:12:41"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6380/WALL-E_(character).png,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6380/conversions/WALL-E_(character)-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6380/conversions/WALL-E_(character)-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 22:12:41

Our idea is to build a simple, smart web application that helps anyone planning an outdoor activity—whether it’s a trip, a hike, or a celebration—see the chance of bad weather for the location and date they choose.

Instead of short-term forecasts, we use historical NASA Earth observation data to calculate the probability of events like extreme heat, heavy rain, or strong winds.
The user simply enters a city and a date, and the app instantly shows a clear probability and easy-to-read graphic to guide their plans.

Our goal is to deliver an intuitive tool that makes everyday decisions easier, and to show how data science and machine learning can turn decades of NASA data into smarter choices for everyone.,null,2,virtual,null,[{"id":1265,"uuid":"7251","name":"Arwa Muhammad Ali Galal","email":"rogalal2003@gmail.com","phone_number":"01092515954","age":"22","gender":"female","address":"Luxor","is_new":false,"organization":"Luxor university","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30307262700286","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:34:45"},{"id":1266,"uuid":"6384","name":"Zeinab Eltaib  Hagag Yussef","email":"zenabeltaib534@gmail.com","phone_number":"01200912796","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"Luxor","is_new":false,"organization":"Luxor university","participation_type":2,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30407062701827","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:34:45"},{"id":1267,"uuid":"6835","name":"Aya Muhammad Hussien Elnoby","email":"aya667015@gmail.com","phone_number":"01142735780","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"Luxor","is_new":false,"organization":"Luxor university","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30402012702529","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:34:45"},{"id":1268,"uuid":"6816","name":"Rowena Sayed Abdullah","email":"rwyntsyd3@gmail.com","phone_number":"01151192971","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"Luxor","is_new":false,"organization":"Luxor university","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30411082700905","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:34:45"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6412/WhatsApp-Image-2025-09-27-at-01.25.42_9795be07.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6412/conversions/WhatsApp-Image-2025-09-27-at-01.25.42_9795be07-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6412/conversions/WhatsApp-Image-2025-09-27-at-01.25.42_9795be07-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 22:34:45

In the game, players choose from different agricultural challenges that farmers face, such as flooding and drought, and work to solve them using real farming practices. 
The game starts off with an overview map, based on NASA’s satellite data, showing the countries most affected by agricultural issues. Players will learn about one of the countries enduring such agricultural challenges, and how they deal with the issue. 
The player will take on the role of a local farmer, and will experiment with different farming techniques, such as mulching during high heat and will find out which solutions are most effective. Players earn points when they correctly identify the best-fitting and sustainable agricultural practices. Once a player finishes a challenge, they can move on to another challenge such as drought, flooding, soil salinization, etc.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1269,"uuid":"7864","name":"Alaa Abdelnaser Mostafa","email":"laaabdelna@gmail.com","phone_number":"01027031077","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"Cairo","is_new":false,"organization":"German University in Cairo","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30404301600249","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:42:30"},{"id":1270,"uuid":"9584","name":"Esraa Ahmed Alsayed","email":"esraahmed109@gmail.com","phone_number":"01010749807","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"Cairo","is_new":false,"organization":"German University in Cairo","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30409100100401","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:42:30"},{"id":1271,"uuid":"3258","name":"Malak Hisham Sallam","email":"malaksallam228@gmail.com","phone_number":"01061778143","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"Cairo","is_new":false,"organization":"German University in Cairo","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30408220101324","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:42:30"},{"id":1272,"uuid":"6196","name":"Mennatulla Ahmed Elsabagh","email":"mennasabbagh43@gmail.com","phone_number":"01001065503","age":"22","gender":"female","address":"Cairo","is_new":false,"organization":"German University in Cairo","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30308060103525","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:42:30"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6417/team.jpeg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6417/conversions/team-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6417/conversions/team-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 22:42:30

We chose this approach because space weather, especially solar flares and CMEs, can feel abstract and difficult to understand, yet it has real-world impacts such as GPS disruptions, communication failures, and effects on aviation.

The video will present the story through two perspectives: first, from an Earthling experiencing the effects of space weather (e.g., losing GPS signals or facing flight delays); and second, from the perspective of the Sun or a solar storm itself, narrating its journey through space to Earth. By merging both viewpoints, we aim to create a fun, engaging, and informative experience.

To make it accessible, we will produce the video in two versions: Arabic and English, supported by visuals, animations, and relatable analogies, ensuring that children can both enjoy the story and understand the science behind it.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1273,"uuid":"6704","name":"Doha  mohmed ELmonzer","email":"dohaelmonzer@gmail.com","phone_number":"01099824346","age":"23","gender":"female","address":"aga-Dakahlia","is_new":false,"organization":"Gen s","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30209131201983","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:57:37"},{"id":1274,"uuid":"1148","name":"Mariam Ahmed Ebrahim Elyamany","email":"elyamaanny@gmail.com","phone_number":"01123910558","age":"23","gender":"female","address":"Maadi","is_new":false,"organization":"Shaker consultancy group","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30208241200722","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:57:37"},{"id":1275,"uuid":"9576","name":"Mohammed Alaa Mohammed Al-Basati","email":"mohassan08563@gmail.com","phone_number":"01024112206","age":"23","gender":"male","address":"Damietta","is_new":false,"organization":"Met","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30210291100456","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:57:37"},{"id":1276,"uuid":"7552","name":"Salma Hisham Ahmed","email":"salmaahisham06@gmail.com","phone_number":"01027276057","age":"23","gender":"female","address":"madinati altajamue 5","is_new":false,"organization":"Shorouk Academy","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30207131201468","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:57:37"},{"id":1277,"uuid":"9516","name":"Mohamed Ayman Abdel Fattah Hassan Ahmed","email":"mohamed.ayman2002k@gmail.com","phone_number":"01095437925","age":"23","gender":"male","address":"Mansoura,Ahmed Maher, Osama Bin Zaid Street, next to CIB Bank","is_new":false,"organization":"Met","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30209151201955","created_at":"2025-09-26 22:57:37"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6422/team-photo.png,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6422/conversions/team-photo-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6422/conversions/team-photo-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 22:57:37

Instead of dumping plastics as unsafe waste or storing them as worthless trash, they are processed into useful products: 3D printing filament and durable construction blocks. The initial step is to collect and sort the plastic waste from equipment and packaging. Then the most suitable thermo plastics are selected those having the property melting several times, with stable melting points between 180°C to 260°C and without the emission of toxic fumes. The plastics are also dense with polymers and hydrogen. The plastic is extruded into filament after shredding and cleaning for the production of tools and spare parts. Half is combined with Martian minerals such as plagioclase, pyroxene, and basaltic glass to form concrete like composites.

We want to learn how flowers and plants bloom and why this is important for bees, farmers, and the Earth. Plants bloom in different seasons, and this gives us food, oxygen, and beauty. But sometimes people do not know the best time when plants bloom. This makes it harder for bees to find flowers and for farmers to grow food.
Our solution is simple and fun. In our classroom, we will plant seeds like beans or lentils and watch them grow every day. We will draw pictures, take photos, and write notes in a “Bloom Diary.” At the same time, we will look at NASA satellite images of plants around the Earth. We will then make a poster that shows both our classroom plants and NASA plants together.

By selecting a place and date, users could learn the chances of experiencing certain types of weather. For example, they might discover a 65% probability of extreme heat above 35°C during a summer trip, or a high chance of rainfall during a chosen week.

The system collects surplus food from three main sources: farms, households, and restaurants. The platform then decides whether the food can be reused or should be recycled into fertilizers or animal feed.

Citizens can use the platform to request food or donate their extra meals. Farmers can request fertilizers or animal feed produced from recycled food at affordable prices. A computer vision–powered website analyzes images of the food to check its condition and classify it as edible, compostable, or suitable for feed.

Additionally, the platform integrates NASA resources to recommend the most suitable type of fertilizer based on soil and location data.

The experience begins with onboarding, then a buoyancy mini-game where users balance weight underwater, simulating astronaut training while linking it to diving medicine and robotics on Earth.

Next, users explore the Cupola: powered by NASA’s Image and Video Library. By searching a city and date, they receive authentic photos narrated by an AI assistant, showing how imagery supports wildfire response, agriculture, and climate monitoring.

A vertical scrolling feed then highlights Earth benefits, like ECOSTRESS aiding farmers or night-light imagery guiding urban planning.

We combine a tabular ensemble (gradient-boosted trees) trained on astrophysical features (depth, duration, SNR, odd/even tests) with a 1D-CNN operating on raw light curves; an ensemble meta-model merges their outputs for robust classification. 
Explainability is central: SHAP values explain tabular decisions, and saliency/Grad-CAM highlights the light-curve regions that the CNN used. We perform systematic injection–recovery tests to quantify detectability as a function of depth and period. 
Post-acceptance, we will build an interactive “Exoplanet Explorer” web UI that lets users query star IDs, view model outputs and explanations, and inject synthetic planets to test detectability.

The main goal is to help people easily understand weather conditions before important events or outdoor activities. By using open-source data from providers such as NASA and OpenWeather, the application will be able to predict rain, cloud coverage, and other weather factors. This ensures users can plan their schedules more effectively and avoid unexpected disruptions.

The strength of this idea lies in the wide availability of free or low-cost weather data through APIs, which makes the solution both accessible and scalable. Initially, the project can start with basic predictive charts or interactive maps without relying on complex deep learning models. In the future, it can expand with features like personalized notifications, real-time updates, and a user-friendly interface to make the tool more engaging and impactful.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1487,"uuid":"1300","name":"Hassan Ashraf Hassan","email":"hass3443an@gmail.com","phone_number":"01120493443","age":"19","gender":"male","address":"20 shaheen st - Haram - Giza","is_new":false,"organization":"Helwan university","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30601082103137","created_at":"2025-09-27 05:45:06"},{"id":1488,"uuid":"9081","name":"Ahmed Bakr Abd El Hafez Muhammed","email":"abakr4268@gmail.com","phone_number":"01099841660","age":"19","gender":"male","address":"12 Abdel Hadi Talab Street - Abu El Leil - Bulaq El Dakrour - Giza","is_new":false,"organization":"Fayoum University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30512230104919","created_at":"2025-09-27 05:45:06"},{"id":1489,"uuid":"2764","name":"Mohamed Ashraf Ahmed","email":"migo122221@gmail.com","phone_number":"01068163026","age":"19","gender":"male","address":"11Amer street, Giza","is_new":false,"organization":"Galala University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30608120101652","created_at":"2025-09-27 05:45:06"},{"id":1490,"uuid":"8922","name":"Khaled Nageh Khalifa","email":"Khaledsucceed@gmail.com","phone_number":"01007470560","age":"20","gender":"male","address":"Dar misr alandalos 2","is_new":false,"organization":"Galala University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30505282701315","created_at":"2025-09-27 05:45:06"},{"id":1491,"uuid":"3810","name":"Fatma Osama Fawzy","email":"fatmaufawzy@gmail.com","phone_number":"01061805797","age":"19","gender":"female","address":"4 Abdel Mohsen Street - Al-Arbaeen - Suez","is_new":false,"organization":"Galala University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30603180400487","created_at":"2025-09-27 05:45:06"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6682/Team.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6682/conversions/Team-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6682/conversions/Team-preview.jpg,2025-09-27 05:45:06

Unlike existing partial solutions, it processes plastics, fabrics, paper, and foams within a single modular unit. Plastics are shredded and either extruded into 3D printing filaments or converted via pyrolysis into fuel gases and oils. Fabrics are mechanically recovered into insulation or reused for cleaning and filters. Paper and cardboard are pulped into panels or transformed into biochar and gases. Foams are either mechanically rebonded into insulation or chemically depolymerized to recover raw materials.
All operations occur inside a sealed chamber equipped with filters and heat recovery systems, ensuring zero harmful emissions. Outputs—such as 3D printing materials, insulation panels, and stored fuel gases—directly support spacecraft needs, reduce Earth resupply dependency, and improve sustainability.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1522,"uuid":"5467","name":"Basmal Gamal Aboseada","email":"besogamal550@gmail.com","phone_number":"01551489763","age":"17","gender":"female","address":"Egypt Menoufia tala center","is_new":false,"organization":"Abdullah Yassin Hamad Secondary School","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30807211701582","created_at":"2025-09-27 06:34:54"},{"id":1523,"uuid":"1564","name":"Jana Yasser Mahmoud","email":"janayasserfarouk@gmail.com","phone_number":"01008438275","age":"17","gender":"female","address":"Eastern Egypt Zagazig","is_new":false,"organization":"Ali Zaki islamic school","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30904191301286","created_at":"2025-09-27 06:34:54"},{"id":1524,"uuid":"2985","name":"Mariam Bahaa El-Din Mosa","email":"moshira198471@gmail.com","phone_number":"01110281219","age":"15","gender":"female","address":"Egypt Hadayek Al Ahram","is_new":false,"organization":"Tahia maser Graphic Languages","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"310004200502004","created_at":"2025-09-27 06:34:54"},{"id":1525,"uuid":"4281","name":"Ruqia h Ahmed Mohammed","email":"roqia10ahmad333@gmail.com","phone_number":"01050338621","age":"15","gender":"female","address":"Egypt Giza Faisal","is_new":false,"organization":"Hamza Bin Abd El , Muttalib Secondary School for Girls","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"31005192400104","created_at":"2025-09-27 06:34:54"},{"id":1526,"uuid":"8141","name":"Minna Allah Ahmed Hameed","email":"mennaallahahmed35@gmail.com","phone_number":"01276203226","age":"16","gender":"female","address":"egypt cairo dar salam","is_new":false,"organization":"Hawiati secondary school for girls","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30908310102985","created_at":"2025-09-27 06:34:54"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6724/IMG-20250926-WA0071.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6724/conversions/IMG-20250926-WA0071-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6724/conversions/IMG-20250926-WA0071-preview.jpg,2025-09-27 06:34:54

Many people do not realize how simple daily actions, like throwing trash or burning waste, can harm nature and affect future generations. Our idea is to create a web-based game where the player experiences the results of different choices. For example, if the player decides to cut down trees or burn a forest, the game will show the negative impact, such as air pollution, loss of animals, or higher global warming. But the game will not stop at the problem. It will also guide the player to transform harmful results into useful opportunities, like planting trees, recycling, or using clean energy such as solar panels. This makes the game both educational and motivating.

Our project AirGuard powered by TEMPO is designed to transform NASA’s satellite data into something people and institutions can actually use in their daily decisions. The idea is to build a system that combines TEMPO observations with ground based networks like OpenAQ AirNow and Pandora together with weather data from NOAA and OpenWeatherMap. Instead of leaving communities with raw numbers we forecast local air quality for the next 6 to 24 hours validate the results using portable IoT robotics and then deliver the information through two main applications. The first is a web platform for schools hospitals and municipalities where they can monitor conditions and manage alerts. The second is a mobile app for citizens that shows AQI provides health tips and sends real time notifications. By connecting satellites ground truth and weather modeling with AI forecasting AirGuard makes air quality information accurate reliable and immediately actionable,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1618,"uuid":"8508","name":"Shahd Ayman Ibrahim Mohamed","email":"shahdayman040@gmail.com","phone_number":"01210226598","age":"16","gender":"female","address":"Egypt, Port Said Governorate, Al-Manakh District, Hasib Al-Ali Towers","is_new":false,"organization":"Port Said Secondary School for Girls","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30901010301183","created_at":"2025-09-27 07:53:00"},{"id":1619,"uuid":"3072","name":"Youssef Khaled Gameel","email":"yousef.khaled.1280@gmail.com","phone_number":"01279210491","age":"22","gender":"female","address":"Ismailia - Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Portsaid university Computer science - IT","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30310011908377","created_at":"2025-09-27 07:53:00"},{"id":1620,"uuid":"1700","name":"Mohamed Abdelsatar Abdelsamaa","email":"mohammedabdelsatar2006@gmail.com","phone_number":"01124216394","age":"20","gender":"male","address":"El obour / Cairo / Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Elshrouk Academy","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30608033100054","created_at":"2025-09-27 07:53:00"},{"id":1621,"uuid":"8634","name":"Youssef Taha Badawi","email":"Ytaha8586@gmail.com","phone_number":"01066965772","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"Menouf city, Menofia","is_new":false,"organization":"Beni suef national university","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30402121702555","created_at":"2025-09-27 07:53:00"},{"id":1622,"uuid":"8524","name":"Hasaan mohammed hassan amin","email":"hassan.0523042@gmail.com","phone_number":"01099549075","age":"17","gender":"male","address":"Egypt Ismailia Governorate","is_new":false,"organization":"Al-Sewedy International School for Applied Technology and Software","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30812121703598","created_at":"2025-09-27 07:53:00"},{"id":1623,"uuid":"9184","name":"Abdelrhman Karam Hegazy","email":"abdelrhmankaramhegazy@gmail.com","phone_number":"01227244439","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"Khalid ibn El Walid, Qubaa, Gesr Elsuis, Cairo","is_new":false,"organization":"Egypt Japan university of science and technology","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30404230100118","created_at":"2025-09-27 07:53:00"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6842/3BE57A22-A61B-474B-99AE-D05910BD6462.jpeg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6842/conversions/3BE57A22-A61B-474B-99AE-D05910BD6462-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6842/conversions/3BE57A22-A61B-474B-99AE-D05910BD6462-preview.jpg,2025-09-27 07:53:00

To meet the challenge requirements, we employ a robust hybrid strategy: a Random Forest Classifier processes structured tabular data (e.g., planetary and stellar parameters), and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) directly examines time-series light curves. This two-pronged approach ensures high accuracy (up to 99% for CNNs) in distinguishing real exoplanet transits from spurious positives, dramatically streamlining the discovery pipeline.

Furthermore, Hypercodex incorporates an easy-to-use, publicly available web interface. Developed with a high-performance Python framework like Streamlit, the platform allows users—from researchers to beginners—to input new data for real-time classification, view essential model performance metrics, and engage directly with the scientific data.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1658,"uuid":"5448","name":"Mohamed Abdelhamid Adel Abdelhamid Fathi","email":"mohammad-abdelhamid@hotmail.com","phone_number":"01060011256","age":"19","gender":"male","address":"8-amin Elsherbiny Giza Egypt","is_new":false,"organization":"Egyptian Chinese University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30610152104135","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:34:45"},{"id":1659,"uuid":"8433","name":"Jana Mohammed El-Sayed Othman El-Hakeem","email":"Jae200623@gmail.com","phone_number":"01090574356","age":"19","gender":"female","address":"التجمع الاول، مجاورة ١١ على ١٢","is_new":false,"organization":"Egyptian Chinese University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30609230103703","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:34:45"},{"id":1660,"uuid":"3620","name":"Karim sherif ismail ali","email":"Karimsheriff22@gmail.com","phone_number":"01220137430","age":"20","gender":"male","address":"١٠ محمد طلعت سالم المنطقة الاولى","is_new":false,"organization":"Egyptian Chinese University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30506240105816","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:34:45"},{"id":1661,"uuid":"7766","name":"omar ahmed sayed stohy ibrahim","email":"omar19611@icloud.com","phone_number":"01205022692","age":"19","gender":"male","address":"عمارة 685 جاردينيا","is_new":false,"organization":"Egyptian Chinese University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30602010104976","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:34:45"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6891/WhatsApp-Image-2025-09-27-at-11.24.05_925a55a5.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6891/conversions/WhatsApp-Image-2025-09-27-at-11.24.05_925a55a5-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6891/conversions/WhatsApp-Image-2025-09-27-at-11.24.05_925a55a5-preview.jpg,2025-09-27 08:34:45

Unlike optical imagery, which depends on daylight and clear skies, SAR can penetrate clouds, smoke, and darkness. In flood events, SAR reveals inundated areas hidden beneath clouds, supporting faster relief planning. During wildfires, it can capture structural changes in vegetation even when thick smoke blocks optical sensors. Instead of developing a detection algorithm, our project highlights real world scenarios where SAR outperforms traditional methods, demonstrating its potential to save lives and reduce damages by ensuring reliable, timely data. By showcasing these advantages through case studies and visual comparisons, Beyond Unseen aims to raise awareness of SAR’s unique role in disaster response and advocate for its wider integration into global emergency management systems.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1696,"uuid":"7708","name":"Jana Ahmed Abosrea Fathi","email":"janaahmed1955@gmail.com","phone_number":"01150151973","age":"17","gender":"female","address":"6 ش عبد المنعم عبدالسلام -طرة- المعادى","is_new":false,"organization":"New Cairo STEM School","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30804260102105","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:49:20"},{"id":1697,"uuid":"2471","name":"Nazan Amr Sadek shehata","email":"nazaneducation@gmail.com","phone_number":"01206593899","age":"16","gender":"female","address":"٤ شارع المنيرى متفرع من شارع مصر و السودان حدائق القبه","is_new":false,"organization":"New Cairo STEM School","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30904070100127","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:49:20"},{"id":1698,"uuid":"7074","name":"Nada Khaled Makram Fawzey","email":"nada.3024543@stemnewcairo.moe.edu.eg","phone_number":"01201088025","age":"16","gender":"female","address":"بني سويف شارع الاباصيري","is_new":false,"organization":"New Cairo STEM School","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30906123201787","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:49:20"},{"id":1699,"uuid":"7196","name":"Mariam Yasser Hassan Ali","email":"mariamysrhassan@gmail.com","phone_number":"01141315067","age":"16","gender":"female","address":"مدينة 15 مايو مجاورة 20 مجموعة 3","is_new":false,"organization":"New Cairo STEM School","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30904250501685","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:49:20"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6937/5960827979196124077.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6937/conversions/5960827979196124077-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6937/conversions/5960827979196124077-preview.jpg,2025-09-27 08:49:20

Unlike traditional apps that focus on short-term forecasts, sectors such as agriculture, infrastructure, tourism, and public safety need insights into the likelihood of adverse conditions—extreme heat, cold, rain, wind, or discomfort—based on decades of data.

The dashboard lets users select a location (city, coordinates, or interactive map) and a date or day-of-year. It queries MERRA-2, subsets the relevant data, and calculates probabilities of exceeding default or custom thresholds. Results are shown as probability cards, time series, histograms, and trend plots with clear explanations. Data and metadata can be exported in CSV, JSON, or NetCDF.

By converting complex climate variables into accessible insights, the tool enables transparent, rigorous, and scalable decision-making for climate-informed planning.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1715,"uuid":"5717","name":"Mohamed Ahmed Mostafa","email":"mezo.225577@gmail.com","phone_number":"01508019645","age":"20","gender":"male","address":"abu kabir sharkia","is_new":false,"organization":"zagazig / computers and information","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30410301303376","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:52:14"},{"id":1716,"uuid":"5032","name":"Mohamed Khaled Omar","email":"mk76yt@gmail.com","phone_number":"01274592411","age":"20","gender":"male","address":"sharkia","is_new":false,"organization":"zagazig / computers and information","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30412111302937","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:52:14"},{"id":1717,"uuid":"1722","name":"Ezz edin Nabil","email":"Nabilmalek48@gmail.com","phone_number":"01211591740","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"sharkia","is_new":false,"organization":"zagazig / computers and information","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30409061300414","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:52:14"},{"id":1718,"uuid":"3337","name":"Mohamed Elsayed","email":"mohamed.elsayed.dev2@gmail.com","phone_number":"01092593386","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"sharkia","is_new":false,"organization":"zagazig / computers and information","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30407011300999","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:52:14"},{"id":1719,"uuid":"3109","name":"Menna Bashir","email":"mennabashir00@gmail.com","phone_number":"01554619025","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"sharkia","is_new":false,"organization":"zagazig / computers and information","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30412071302521","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:52:14"},{"id":1720,"uuid":"3910","name":"Amar Yasser","email":"amaryasser.dev@gmail.com","phone_number":"01068919327","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"sharkia","is_new":false,"organization":"zagazig / computers and information","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30407131303316","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:52:14"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6960/im.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6960/conversions/im-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6960/conversions/im-preview.jpg,2025-09-27 08:52:14

When users enter the number of crew members and mission length, the system generates a tailored 3D habitat model. Each model dynamically adjusts in size and functionality for example, a short mission for two crew members produces a compact layout with essential rooms, while a longer mission with more people expands to include extra bedrooms, multiple sanitation modules, and additional storage.

Inside the habitat, users can explore rooms and place key equipment such as galley stations, hygiene units, medical bays, treadmills, or spare parts. The platform applies realistic rules, warning if incompatible items are placed too close (hygiene near medical). telling them why it is incompatible and what should they do instead.

It refers to changes between the Sun and Earth that affect our planet—like disrupting GPS, wireless communication, and power grids. Yet, most people, especially kids, don’t understand what it is, how it happens, or its consequences.

Our solution is an animation video made for children. Instead of a website or app, we chose a playful medium that mixes fun, imagination, and learning.

The story follows a girl and her family facing problems caused by space weather. A magical aurora beam guides her on an exciting journey to learn what space weather is, how it affects Earth, and how to stay safe.

What makes our idea unique is its use of imaginative storytelling to spark curiosity, helping kids enjoy and understand science while gaining awareness and exploration skills for the future.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1733,"uuid":"1413","name":"Jana Ayman","email":"jnyywmyat57@gmail.com","phone_number":"01092387809","age":"14","gender":"female","address":"Sharqia , San Alhagar","is_new":false,"organization":"Preparatory school","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"31110011328081","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:56:26"},{"id":1734,"uuid":"1130","name":"Hagar Adel","email":"ha8276067@gmail.com","phone_number":"01097290049","age":"15","gender":"female","address":"Sharqia , San Alhagar","is_new":false,"organization":"Secondery school","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"31007201302369","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:56:26"},{"id":1735,"uuid":"1739","name":"Laila Reda","email":"lylareda786@gmail.com","phone_number":"01020576661","age":"14","gender":"female","address":"Sharqia ,New Salhya","is_new":false,"organization":"Preparatory school","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"31107201302606","created_at":"2025-09-27 08:56:26"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6983/صورة-واتساب-بتاريخ-2025-09-27-في-10.05.11_e28aca90.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6983/conversions/صورة-واتساب-بتاريخ-2025-09-27-في-10.05.11_e28aca90-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/6983/conversions/صورة-واتساب-بتاريخ-2025-09-27-في-10.05.11_e28aca90-preview.jpg,2025-09-27 08:56:26

NASA’s Kepler, K2, and TESS missions have produced millions of stellar light curves that capture brightness variations of distant stars. Within these data, periodic dips can signal the presence of orbiting planets. Manual inspection and citizen science were useful in the past, but the massive scale of current datasets requires automated methods.

Our approach applies machine learning to curated data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. By training models on labeled light curves, the system learns to identify patterns that distinguish real planetary transits from noise or stellar variability.

In a three-year mission, an eight-person crew generates over 12,600 kg of plastics, metals, textiles, and glass. Instead of storing or discarding this waste, Trash2Mars converts it into structural blocks, shielding, and repair materials.

Plastics and textiles are processed through microwave pyrolysis, producing carbon residues and backup fuels. Metals, glass, and ceramics are melted in an electric smelter and blended with Martian regolith to create radiation-resistant panels and tiles.

By turning waste into construction and protection, Trash2Mars eliminates hazards, reduces dependence on Earth, and supports astronaut survival with a sustainable closed-loop model: Waste + Regolith = Life Support.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1779,"uuid":"4484","name":"Mina Sameh","email":"sos229072@gmail.com","phone_number":"01027382269","age":"17","gender":"male","address":"Cairo, Nasr City","is_new":false,"organization":"St. Fatima Language School El hegaz","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30806270104656","created_at":"2025-09-27 09:00:15"},{"id":1780,"uuid":"4912","name":"Basmala Elgohary","email":"basmalaelgohary444@gmail.com","phone_number":"01227289612","age":"19","gender":"female","address":"Menia","is_new":false,"organization":"Sinai University Kantara Branch (SUK)","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30609262403709","created_at":"2025-09-27 09:00:15"},{"id":1781,"uuid":"2874","name":"Mariam Fayeq Gabriel","email":"mariamfaik4@gmail.com","phone_number":"01099223153","age":"21","gender":"female","address":"Fayoum","is_new":false,"organization":"Fayoum University, Faculty of agriculture","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30409032300685","created_at":"2025-09-27 09:00:15"},{"id":1782,"uuid":"9294","name":"Esraa Samir Ahmed","email":"esraasamirr2005@gmail.com","phone_number":"01154905272","age":"20","gender":"female","address":"Zagazig","is_new":false,"organization":"Zagazig University/ faculty of science/","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30509011308044","created_at":"2025-09-27 09:00:15"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/7039/Trash2Mars.PNG,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/7039/conversions/Trash2Mars-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/7039/conversions/Trash2Mars-preview.jpg,2025-09-27 09:00:15

It tackles the key problem in maritime accidents: rescuers often lack real-time knowledge of who is alive, who is critical, and where to act first. Traditional jackets only float, and GPS-only devices provide location without context leading to delays and higher mortality.

The jacket integrates a RockBLOCK 9603 Iridium module, enabling global, low-latency communication through the Iridium LEO satellite network.

The core idea is an AI-enabled closed-loop system that classifies and processes heterogeneous waste streams (metals, plastics, and textiles) autonomously. The system uses three tailored pathways: induction melting of metals for casting (utilizing regolith molds), thermal compression molding of plastics into structural components, and chemical/mechanical processing to reclaim textile fibers.
Managed by a central AI orchestrator, this solution maximizes resource utilization, minimizes waste volume, and dramatically reduces dependency on Earth resupply. This novel, end-to-end automation enhances mission resilience and establishes a sustainable, circular economy essential for permanent off-world habitation,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1808,"uuid":"1848","name":"Abd El-Rahman Mousa","email":"abdelrahmanmousa365@gmail.com","phone_number":"01015384128","age":"16","gender":"male","address":"Damietta,New Damietta","is_new":false,"organization":"Abu Bakr Al Sidddiq","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30901031100315","created_at":"2025-09-27 09:02:16"},{"id":1809,"uuid":"4430","name":"Mennah Islam","email":"bakisl2007@gmail.com","phone_number":"01112751588","age":"17","gender":"female","address":"Alexandria, Almontzah","is_new":false,"organization":"Alexandria University","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30710118800748","created_at":"2025-09-27 09:02:16"},{"id":1810,"uuid":"3080","name":"Zyad znaty","email":"abdelrahmanmousa362@gmail.com","phone_number":"01026541036","age":"18","gender":"male","address":"Damietta, New Damietta","is_new":false,"organization":"German International University","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30707091100593","created_at":"2025-09-27 09:02:16"},{"id":1811,"uuid":"8621","name":"Yusof El-Badry","email":"yoseefelbadry322@gmail.com","phone_number":"01110340998","age":"21","gender":"male","address":"Giza, Haram","is_new":false,"organization":"Cairo University","participation_type":2,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30402022104174","created_at":"2025-09-27 09:02:16"},{"id":1812,"uuid":"8788","name":"Haneen Ali","email":"haneenali352@gmail.com","phone_number":"01091106553","age":"20","gender":"female","address":"Damietta,  New Damietta","is_new":false,"organization":"Damietta University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30503038800686","created_at":"2025-09-27 09:02:16"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/7078/bc4a59f6-4c6b-4549-a258-a6de400b884f.jpeg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/7078/conversions/bc4a59f6-4c6b-4549-a258-a6de400b884f-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/7078/conversions/bc4a59f6-4c6b-4549-a258-a6de400b884f-preview.jpg,2025-09-27 09:02:16

The video will introduce a fun, relatable animated character who serves as a guide, taking children on a journey through space in a way that feels interactive and exciting. The character will explain key ideas such as gravity, atmosphere, and how space phenomena influence Earth in simple, age-appropriate language. To make the experience more immersive, we will use creative video editing techniques, animations, and sound effects that capture children’s imagination and maintain their attention. The video will also include interactive segments where children are encouraged to answer questions or think about “what if” scenarios, making the learning process participatory rather than passive.

In a three-year Mars trip, 6–8 astronauts will generate over three tons of inorganic waste (plastics, metals, textiles, and mixed materials). Instead of storage or costly return to Earth, our system transforms waste into usable resources. A swarm of autonomous robots, inspired by WALL-E, collects and sorts debris around the habitat. At a central HUB, plastics become 3D-printing filament, metals are smelted into sheets or powder, textiles compressed for insulation, and non-recyclables converted via plasma gasification into energy and building blocks. Operating 70–80% autonomously with AI and robotics, the system leaves humans for complex oversight. Beyond Mars, this innovation could reshape recycling on Earth, turning waste into opportunity for smarter, cleaner, and more sustainable living.,null,1,onsite,null,[{"id":1938,"uuid":"4024","name":"Mahenour Mosad Eissa","email":"maheeissa1999@gmail.com","phone_number":"01016264354","age":"19","gender":"female","address":"Damietta, Elsynania","is_new":false,"organization":"Ain Shams University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30602151100869","created_at":"2025-09-27 09:52:24"},{"id":1939,"uuid":"6330","name":"Shahd Khalifa Abdelmageed Ibrahim","email":"shahdkhalefa131@gmail.com","phone_number":"01286848925","age":"19","gender":"female","address":"Qalyubia, Sheben Elqnater","is_new":false,"organization":"Ain Shams University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30601011411426","created_at":"2025-09-27 09:52:24"},{"id":1940,"uuid":"1792","name":"Mahmoud Ahmed El-Sayed Mira","email":"mahmoudmira0065@gmail.com","phone_number":"01062537750","age":"19","gender":"male","address":"Ismailia, El-Sheikh Zayed","is_new":false,"organization":"Mansoura University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"team_lead","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30603201901198","created_at":"2025-09-27 09:52:24"},{"id":1941,"uuid":"7625","name":"Roqaya Wael Sayed Ahmed","email":"rokaw50@gmail.com","phone_number":"01158017775","age":"19","gender":"female","address":"Cairo, Matarya, 14 Elbalsm Street","is_new":false,"organization":"Cairo University","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30610010102062","created_at":"2025-09-27 09:52:24"},{"id":1942,"uuid":"2692","name":"Mariam Haitham Mashoud","email":"mariammashoud0@gmail.com","phone_number":"01019888540","age":"19","gender":"female","address":"Qalyubia, Sheben Elqnater","is_new":false,"organization":"GIU","participation_type":1,"member_role":"member","extra_field":null,"notes":null,"national":"30611271401489","created_at":"2025-09-27 09:52:24"}],https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/7263/NASA-Team-(1).png,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/7263/conversions/NASA-Team-(1)-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/7263/conversions/NASA-Team-(1)-preview.jpg,2025-09-27 09:52:24
