The platform provides a clear daily “air card” with an easy-to-read index, practical health tips, and alerts if the air becomes unsafe. A second page shows the entire globe in 3D, letting users explore other countries, compare pollution levels, and even see government actions worldwide. Behind the scenes, the system combines open data from NASA, OpenAQ, and local sources, then applies analysis and predictions to highlight risks and trends. Extra features include a kids’ mode with simple messages, historical comparisons, and community data sharing.

We clean and align Kepler, K2, and TESS light curves, then let a hybrid model (CNN for shapes, gradient-boosting for context) spot the tiny, honest dips that planets make—and flag the tricks from noise or binaries. But this isn’t a black box: we pair every “candidate” with explanations, saliency highlights, and simple language so humans—astronomers, students, and citizen scientists—can trust and verify. A web app turns results into stories: browse likely worlds, inspect the light, leave notes, and vote on confidence. The loop is human-in-the-middle: AI accelerates, people validate, science advances.

NASA’s imagery and data provide the science, while human-centered stories bring the emotional side to life.

For the hackathon, we will create a 3–5 minute demo episode in English with captions, showcasing one case in depth, plus outlines for four more episodes.

Satellites and orbital platforms generate large amounts of heat, usually expelled into space with radiators. Our compact device, about the size of a pizza box, uses thermoelectric generators (TEGs) to convert this unused heat directly into electricity. The system can be installed on satellites, stations, or tourism platforms to provide three key benefits: free power for CubeSats and onboard systems, efficient heating for modules without added energy costs, and a new revenue stream for operators by monetizing what was once discarded. Delivered through a “Power-as-a-Service” model, we supply energy at no upfront cost in exchange for a share of the savings.

In humid cities, high atmospheric moisture weakens buildings and harms indoor health. Humidity-sensitive facades using NASA humidity data (AIRS, MODIS) and smart materials can regulate airflow and moisture, reducing mold and structural damage. Cities also consume huge energy for cooling and lighting due to solar radiation. Solar-adaptive architecture applies NASA solar and thermal data (CERES, MODIS) to design facades with reflective coatings and dynamic shading that respond to sunlight, cutting energy use and improving comfort. Urban zones are also key CO₂ sources. Carbon-absorbing facades integrate bio-based or chemical materials that capture carbon, guided by NASA OCO-2 data.

Air pollution, particularly particulate matter, poses serious risks to human health, climate, and ecosystems, making effective filtration urgently needed. The system works by passing polluted air between two metal plates connected to a mosquito zapper that provides high voltage (5000 volts). As the air flows through, particles like dust, smoke and other pollutants become electrically charged and are attracted to the plates, leaving cleaner air to exit the device. This method is energy efficient and cost effective since it relies on simple materials and requires minimal maintenance.

Exoplanets are extremely difficult to find because they are small, faint, and hidden by their stars’ bright light. Traditional methods require a lot of time and expertise, but AI can make this process faster and more accurate.

The system works in two main steps. First, it applies computer vision to telescope images, using deep learning to identify tiny patterns that might indicate a planet. Second, it analyzes light curves, which show how a star’s brightness changes over time. If a planet passes in front of a star, the brightness dips slightly, and AI can detect this signal with high precision.

The tool will then analyze this information and show clear, easy-to-read graphs along with a simple score that suggests whether a planet might be there.

The aim is not only to support scientific discovery but also to make the process approachable for students, educators, and anyone curious about exoplanets.,null,1,onsite,null,Rostislav Kuzin, Vladislav Tolubaev,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5959/photo_2025-09-26_23-45-36.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5959/conversions/photo_2025-09-26_23-45-36-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/5959/conversions/photo_2025-09-26_23-45-36-preview.jpg,2025-09-26 20:49:13

Waste from fabrics, packaging, and structural composites consumes valuable storage and demands costly resupply. To address this, we propose the Jezero Resource Reclamation Hub (J-RRH)—a fully automated recycling system enabling high vehicle-crew autonomy (G5/G6). J-RRH converts waste into usable resources through: (1) mechanical shredding and separation of plastics and metals, (2) thermal pyrolysis of composites at 550 °C in inert conditions to recover reinforcement fibers, and (3) hydrogen generation from plastic-derived syngas, purified with PdAg membranes for fuel and synthesis. These outputs—AM filament, recovered fibers, and hydrogen—support in-situ manufacturing and energy needs.

To meet the challenge requirements, we employ a robust hybrid strategy: a Random Forest Classifier processes structured tabular data (e.g., planetary and stellar parameters), and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) directly examines time-series light curves. This two-pronged approach ensures high accuracy (up to 99% for CNNs) in distinguishing real exoplanet transits from spurious positives, dramatically streamlining the discovery pipeline.

Furthermore, Hypercodex incorporates an easy-to-use, publicly available web interface.

Unlike traditional apps that focus on short-term forecasts, sectors such as agriculture, infrastructure, tourism, and public safety need insights into the likelihood of adverse conditions—extreme heat, cold, rain, wind, or discomfort—based on decades of data.

The dashboard lets users select a location (city, coordinates, or interactive map) and a date or day-of-year. It queries MERRA-2, subsets the relevant data, and calculates probabilities of exceeding default or custom thresholds. Results are shown as probability cards, time series, histograms, and trend plots with clear explanations. Data and metadata can be exported in CSV, JSON, or NetCDF.

When users enter the number of crew members and mission length, the system generates a tailored 3D habitat model. Each model dynamically adjusts in size and functionality for example, a short mission for two crew members produces a compact layout with essential rooms, while a longer mission with more people expands to include extra bedrooms, multiple sanitation modules, and additional storage.

Inside the habitat, users can explore rooms and place key equipment such as galley stations, hygiene units, medical bays, treadmills, or spare parts. The platform applies realistic rules, warning if incompatible items are placed too close (hygiene near medical). telling them why it is incompatible and what should they do instead.

The core idea is an AI-enabled closed-loop system that classifies and processes heterogeneous waste streams (metals, plastics, and textiles) autonomously. The system uses three tailored pathways: induction melting of metals for casting (utilizing regolith molds), thermal compression molding of plastics into structural components, and chemical/mechanical processing to reclaim textile fibers.
Managed by a central AI orchestrator, this solution maximizes resource utilization, minimizes waste volume, and dramatically reduces dependency on Earth resupply. This novel, end-to-end automation enhances mission resilience and establishes a sustainable, circular economy essential for permanent off-world habitation,null,1,onsite,null,Abd El-Rahman Mousa, Mennah Islam, Zyad znaty, Yusof El-Badry, Haneen Ali,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/7078/bc4a59f6-4c6b-4549-a258-a6de400b884f.jpeg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/7078/conversions/bc4a59f6-4c6b-4549-a258-a6de400b884f-thumb.jpg,https://adminpanel.spaceappscairo.com/storage/7078/conversions/bc4a59f6-4c6b-4549-a258-a6de400b884f-preview.jpg,2025-09-27 09:02:16
